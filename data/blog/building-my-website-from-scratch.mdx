I had always wanted to have my own website where I could showcase my work and write blogs, so I finally decided to do it in 2021.

The first challenge was deciding on a JS Framework. I wanted to try something new, so I went with Astro, but it was only a few months old with no solid timeline. Then remix run became open source, and I went with it.

## Tech Stack
Here's what I went with:
- Remix Run
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Contentlayer
